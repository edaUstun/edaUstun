## Hi, I'm Eda 👋

## 📚 About Me

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in *Information Technology at Southern States University*. My interest in information technologies is increasing with the developing technological innovations and my desire to be a partner in these innovations. Especially with the new information I have learned about new technologies such as cloud computing, this interest is increasing and I want to experience how these technologies are actually processed in the business world.

## ☁️ How I Use GitHub and Cloud Computing

I use **Github** to share the projects I have created for my own development during the coding process.
- I use it to store the codes of a collaborative project I did at school. 
- I use it to upload the assignments given by some online coding courses I attended.

By uploading some of my projects to GitHub, I both share my projects and back up my work. Using Github in cloud computing projects will easily provide me with this opportunity when I want to access my code from different devices in the future, and in this way, it will allow me to quickly integrate my code into cloud-based services. 
In this way, sharing code with the team can become more efficient.

## 🚀 Future Goals

I aim to specialize in data analytics in the future.  I am currently working on **Python**, **SQL** and **cloud-based** data services to improve my technical knowledge and skills.
